            <h3>Student of DIU</h3>
            <p>While some programmers like to get things done as quickly as possible, others like to think of their code
                as a beautiful creation. That variable was named exactly right. And that class was so nicely decoupled
                from that other class. And those tests cover my code base perfectly. It goes on. One can look at his own
                code for hours, admiring the beauty.

                Creating readable, maintainable, clean code is not a bad thing by any means. Sure, it might be
                disheartening when another programmer brutally destroys your creation with an ugly patch. But overall,
                it’s very satisfying to make something beautiful.</p>

            <h2>Become a web developer</h2>
            <p>For better or worst, programming involves endless learning. Every day you get to work with a new
                framework, see some new code, learn a new API, etc. This process of self-improvement is very gratifying.
                Every day you’re a bit smarter than the day before. Comparing this to a video game, you’re gaining
                experience points and levels with each new thing you learn.</p>
